StressSuite
===========

General Description
-------------------

StressSuite is a tool that provides a collection of stress suites. Thoses
suites themselves provides stress tests. Thoses stress tests are intented
to stress something specific.


Stress suites
-------------

There is already two stress suites in stresssuite :
 - For the filesystem named 'Files',
 - For the CPU named 'CPU'

Tests for 'Files' testsuite are :
 - 000 : 'Directory creation' : Creates directories in one single directory
 - 001 : 'Files creation' : Creates files in one single directory
 - 002 : 'Zero filed files creation' : Creates zero filed files (size vary and
          buffer size is an option)

Tests for 'CPU' testsuite are :
 - 000 : 'Cpu encode stress' : Stress the cpu(s) with base64 and rot13 functions
 - 001 : 'Cpu hash tests' : Stress the cpu(s) with sha512 and md5 functions


Usage
-----

  NAME
      stresssuite

  SYNOPSIS
      stresssuite [OPTIONS]...

  DESCRIPTION
      Runs stress testsuites

  OPTIONS
      When two exclusive options are specified (like -o and -m for
      instance), the selected one is the last specified on the command
      line.

      -h, --help
        Show this help

      -d, --debug
        More verbose

      -l, --list
        Show all tests with their contexts. When this option is used, it
        will prevail over -o or -m options

      -o, --once
        Runs all tests only once

      -n, --no-stats
        Does not print any stats at the end of the tests

      -c, --cumulative
        Prints stats in a cumulative manner

      --gnuplot=PATH
        Export results (stats) to gnuplot formated files. PATH indicates
        the path where files might be created

      -m NUM, --multiple=NUM
        Tell to run the tests exactly NUM times

      --process=NUM
        Tell the numbers of process for one test (one by default)

      --buffer-size=NUM
        Tells the buffer size to use when creating files (512 by default)

      -s, --step=NUM
        Used in the vary function to step the algorithm (generally it
        is used to multiply the number of tests but it depends on the
        test itself to do what it wants with this value)

      -p PATH, --path=PATH
        Tells which path to use to run stresssuite program.
        '/tmp' by default

      --testname='NAME'
        Selects one test specificaly

      --testsuite='NAME'
        Selects one entire test suite specificaly. If --testname is
        specified at the same time then --testsuite option is ignored

    NAME must be a name as listed by -l or --list option

  EXAMPLES
      ./stresssuite.py -d --path=/home/dup/tmp -m 10
      ./stresssuite.py -d --path=/home/dup/tmp/stressfs --testsuite='Files' \\
        -m 4 -s 10 --process=5
      ./stresssuite.py --list

Constraints
-----------

Should not work with python versions under 2.5 (hashlib and multiprocessing
dependencies)
