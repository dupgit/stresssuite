 . Add new tests on files
 . Add other testsuites (eg to test postgresql for instance)
 . Add testcases and may see how to do coverage tests
 . trap keyboard interrupts ?
 . May be transform step into a list of steps ? If so, we also need to modify
   gnuplot generation and print_c_func (and may be print_stats)
 . Change file names saved with gnuplot export and add number of threads and
   context description

Done :

  . Rename stressfs to stress_suite
  . debug mode
  . Add a Collection Class that will help manage all TestSuites
  . Add options to manage all tests : running a specific test, a
    specific testsuite, how many times tests should run, which path ...
  . Threadable tests
  . Add a test to avoid execution of the vary function if this is the
    last test execution
  . If a parameter is out of range stop execution and print a message
  . Wrong testsuite name bug (missing a report)
  . Add a selector to enable selection of a vary function, say *2 or *10
  . be mode accurate when test could not finish (say which one) and stop
    testing this particular test -> each test should take care of this
    and modify it's context in order not to continue the test (even if
    called)
  . Add a new Test function (relevant_context for instance) that will
    be written for the test and that will return something that will
    resume context in a relevant manner with the point of view of the
    time test comparisons. The aim is to get rid of things that are not
    really necessary for the results (when printing)
  . Add a gnuplot file generation with the results
  . Change the saving directory for the gnuplot files
  . Convert functions arguments of the __init__ Test class method into a tuple
    containing all the wanted functions
