 . Add new tests on files
 . Add other testsuites (eg to test postgresql for instance)
 . Add a gnuplot file generation with the results
 . Add a new Test function (relevant_context for instance) that will
   be written for the test and that will return something that will
   resume context in a relevant manner with the point of view of the
   time test comparisons. The aim is to get rid of things that are not
   really necessary for the results (when printing)
 . trap keyboard interrupts ?


Done :

  . Rename stressfs to stress_suite
  . debug mode
  . Add a Collection Class that will help manage all TestSuites
  . Add options to manage all tests : running a specific test, a
    specific testsuite, how many times tests should run, which path ...
  . Threadable tests
  . Add a test to avoid execution of the vary function if this is the
    last test execution
  . If a parameter is out of range stop execution and print a message
  . Wrong testsuite name bug (missing a report)
  . Add a selector to enable selection of a vary function, say *2 or *10
  . be mode accurate when test could not finish (say which one) and stop
    testing this particular test -> each test should take care of this
    and modify it's context in order not to continue the test (even if
    called)
