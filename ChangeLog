24.11.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Renamed all variables with 'thread' in it to 'process' something
            * Renamed the option --thread to --process
            * Added a new CPU stress test based on hashlib

23.11.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Change from multithreaded to multiprocessed
            * Added a new option --cumulative that cumulates stats from the
              processes for each test.

21.10.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Changed 'coding' to 'encoding'

18.09.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Writing doctests for cpu_stress tests
            * New methods for Options class : transform_to_int() and usage()
              and some new doctests

16.09.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Rewrite of some for statements (more direct is better)
            * Now tests should return a tuple containing a boolean to say wether
              the test ran ok or not an the context : (boolean, context)

09.09.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Added a new stress suite for cpu load with a new stress test using
              base64() algorithm to make the cpu work ! (because hashlib is not
              available in 2.4 and I need to be 2.4 compatible - for now !)
            * Corrected an initialisation bug in TestSuite class

08.09.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Closing the gnuplot file
            * Added a TODO and corrected a typo in Changelog

01.09.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Change the way to call the __init__ function for Test creation :
              Now you must provide a tuple which must contain all the functions
              for the test : an init function, the test itself, a final function
              used to clean or finish the test, a vary function used to vary the
              variable part of the test (if any) and a print context function
              that is used to print the context with various formats (see the
              docstring of that function to know more about it).

31.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Added a testcases.py file that will run each testcases of each
              module. This file is based on test_doc.py from the hachoir project
              thanks to Victor Stinner
            * Added doctests (mainly to fss tests)

27.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Added an argument to the --gnuplot option to indicate the path
              where we want gnuplot generated files to be saved

26.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Begining work with the gnuplot stuff
            * Added --gnuplot option

25.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Added a function to the Test class named print_c_func that may
              be defined whithin the test itself. This function must return a
              string that resumes the context. It is used in the print_stats
              function (not in debug mode)
            * Printing stats is now more fancier

24.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * New file test : Zero Filed Files Creation
              New option : --buffer-size that let one specify a buffer size
              for this new test

21.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Wrong option argument now stops the program and prints a
              message saying what's wrong.
            * Added a stepping (step property to the Test class) that
              allow vary function to steps more or less
            * Added a warning when a specific testsuite is not found

20.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Thread execution times are grouped in one list and
              Test.times is now a list of list. Changed a bit
              print_stats function in order to reflect the changes
            * Managed to avoid side effect with the vary function at
              the last execution of the test

19.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Now each test is threadable (and the test has not to
              bother with this - event if it modifies its context)
            * Added option '--threads' to let people run the number of
              threads they want

18.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Added a Collection Class to manage all future test suites
              that will be written (gleu it's up to you now)
            * added option '-p', '--path', '--testname', '--testsuite'

17.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Transformed all 0 and 1 to False and True (Learning :-)
            * Documentation
            * Trying to apply coding style

16.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Splited in three files :
              - fss.py that concentrate all filesystem stress tools
              - stress.py that provides all the basics classes to do
                the job (have stress tests and stress suites)
              - stresssuite.py which is the main program
            * Converted all print calls to print() function calls

07.08.2009 Olivier DELHOMME <olivier.delhomme@free.fr>
            * Beginning a new project in python
            * Added a context and functions to managed this context
              at the begining and at the end of the running function
              (with default test and such)
            * Added a vary function that is called between succesive
              calls in order to vary the context of the test.
            * added a TODO file
